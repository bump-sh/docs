And to make it more comfortable, we sort them by types (and it looks great, seriously).</p><p>We are already working on two limitations: you cannot search in your spec history and we are lacking advanced filters.</p><p>Discoverability is an important topic on our end. We want to help teams and communities deep dive into their API ecosystem, making them easier to find and use. We will have a lot more to announce soon and we are preparing a small blog post on this feature’s making-of.</p><p>We hope you’ll enjoy the Search Bar: feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or suggestion!</p><p><em>P.S.
