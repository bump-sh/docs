# Meta images

## Add your own image

From your dashboard, select the documentation you would like to edit. If this documentation belongs to a hub, you'll need to select the hub directly.

From the documentation settings, select Customize UI, reach the Social Media section and upload or drop the image you would like to use.

## Use the automated image generation

In case you wouldn't have a visual you could use, Bump will automatically generate an image for social media. This visual display your documentation name (or the hub name, in such case), its logo and its type.

The social media image will be modified each time you change the name or the logo.

First generation of this new social media image may take a bit, but any modification or change will start the generation process. You can also reach our Support to push this new feature.
