One of the greatest new features provided by OpenAPI 3.1 is the support of webhooks. Indeed, a OpenAPI 3.1 documentation may include `paths` and / or `webhooks`, when `paths` were required for previous version.

Every webhook has a required `keyName`, and some operations. If we follow this example, provided for OpenAPI 3.1 by [OpenAPI Initiative](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification):

```yaml
webhooks:
  # Each webhook needs a name
  newPet:
    # This is a Path Item Object, the only difference is that the request is initiated by the API provider
    post:
      description: A new pet arrived, let's come and discover it IRL.
      requestBody:
        description: Information about a new pet in the system
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Return a 200 status to indicate that the data was received successfully
```

Here, there is a single webhook whom `keyName`  is `newPet` , and a `POST` operation. If such a documentation was generated by Bump ([see live documentation](https://bump.sh/bump/doc/webhook-example)):

<!-- ![](/files/undefined) -->

- Webhook's name is deduced from the `keyName.`
- Webhook's operation name is extracted from field `summary.`
- As for endpoints, webhook has body parameters, responses... and some `curl` and `request payload`examples are generated.

Furthermore, webhooks are fully compatible with UI customization **How to group operations?**

By adding some `tags` to your webhooks, you can re-organize how webhooks are named, sorted, and how webhooks operations are sorted.
