## Before you begin

You can host your documentation under your own domain by creating a CNAME record pointing to `custom.bump.sh`.

For instance, if you want to host your documentation under the `developers.example.com `domain, you will create the following record:

```undefined
developers.example.com. 3600 IN CNAME custom.bump.sh.
```

Once this is done, you can [set your custom domain](undefined) in Bump.

## Set a custom domain

1. Click on the chosen **Documentation** **>** **Settings**
2. Check the **Setup a custom domain **box.
3. Enter your custom domain.
4. Click **Update global settings**.
