Fast-loading page is a must these days, both for human users and search engines.

Thanks to the new rendering engine, which has already been released to 100% of our users, navigating your API documentation is now a breeze. It provides an optimal experience for all API consumers, whatever the size of the documentation (yes, any size).

Performance is significantly better: the first interactive content is as fast as the blink of an eye, which also means there's no more blocking time when you first navigate the API documentation.
