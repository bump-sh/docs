title: Search!
categories: [New]

Here comes a long-expected new feature: the Search Bar. We know how time-consuming it can be to scroll through long API documentation to find what you are looking for: the Search Bar solves this in a blink of an eye.

Our Search engine can look in your documentations and even your hubs on your APIs structures: endpoints, objects, properties, webhooks, etc... And to make it more comfortable, we sort them by types (and it looks great, seriously).

We are already working on two limitations: you cannot search in your spec history and we are lacking advanced filters.

Discoverability is an important topic on our end. We want to help teams and communities deep dive into their API ecosystem, making them easier to find and use. We will have a lot more to announce soon and we are preparing a small blog post on this feature’s making-of.

We hope you’ll enjoy the Search Bar: feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or suggestion!

_P.S. Search will be activated on your documentation/hub after the next deploy but please contact us if you need it before this as we can manually activate it._
