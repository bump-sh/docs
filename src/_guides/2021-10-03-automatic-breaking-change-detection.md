If some changes are more important than others, it is especially true for your API.

From now on, we automatically detect if a new version of your API includes some breaking changes. It will be visible in the [changelog page](https://developers.bump.sh/changes), in the changelog email or the brand new RSS feed… but also during your API design phase while opening a pull request thanks to [our Github Action](https://github.com/bump-sh/github-action/).

With Bump, you will never miss a _breaking_ change again.
