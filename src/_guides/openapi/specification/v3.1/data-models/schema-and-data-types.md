One of the most important parts of OpenAPI is the `schema` object. Schema objects are used to describe HTTP request and response bodies, parameters, headers, and all sorts of other data, whether its JSON, XML, or primitive types like integers and strings. 

> If you're familiar with JSON Schema, you'll be right at home here, because OpenAPI v3.1 uses JSON Schema (draft 2020-12). For those who have not used JSON Schema before, that's ok, follow along.
{: .info }

The first thing to learn about a schema is the `type` keyword, which can be one or more of the following types:

- null
- boolean
- object
- array
- number
- string

> You can also use "integer" for the sake of convenience, but "integer" and "number" are basically identical because JSON itself does not make that distinction. Since there is no distinct JSON integer type, JSON Schema defines integers mathematically. This means that both 1 and 1.0 are equivalent, and are both considered to be integers.
{: .info }

A schema object looks like this:

```yaml
type: string
```

It can also define multiple types, for instance making a property nullable:

```yaml
type: [string, null]
```

It also allows you to support properties that could be either a number or a numeric string.

```yaml
type: [number, string]
```

Describing an object will often involve the use of `properties` to define what each of the objects properties should look like, and each of those properties will have a "subschema" that describes it. 

```yaml
type: object
required:
- name
properties:
  name:
    type: string
  age:
    type: integer
```

Arrays work in a similar way, with an `items` keyword allowing each item in the array to be described.

```yaml
type: array
items:
  type: string
```

Arrays of objects can be described by combining the two concepts:

```yaml
type: array
items:
  type: object
  required:
  - name
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
    age:
      type: integer
```

## Data Formats

The `type` keyword sets out the basic data type, but knowing something is a string or an integer is just the first step to understanding what that data is all about.

First of all there's the `format` keyword, which covers a predefined set of common formats:

```yaml
type: array
items:
  type: object
  required:
  - name
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
    email:
      type: string
      format: email
    age:
      type: integer
      format: int32
```

The full list of formats defined in the JSON Schema Validation that OpenAPI v3.1 relies upon:

- date-time:  A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a valid representation according to the "date-time" production as defined in [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339).

- regex - A regular expression, which SHOULD be valid according to the ECMA-262 ecma262 regular expression dialect

You can also define your own custom formats, which tooling will not understand, but that doesn't matter as the specification tells tooling to ignore unknown formats.

## Validation

In addition to defining data types and formats, [JSON Schema](_guides/openapi/specification/v3.1/data-models/json-schema.md) provides several validation keywords to enforce specific constraints on the data. Here are a few popular validation keywords:

### const & enum

Restricting a value down to one or more potential values can be done with the `const` or `enum` keywords. 

First, a look at `enum`, as that keyword has been around longer and is more used:

```yaml
type: string
enum:
  - pending
  - fulfilled
  - archived
```

This says the string can't just be any old string, it has to be one of the approved values listed in `enum`.

> Learn more about const on [JSON-Schema.org: Enumerated Values](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/enum).
{: .info }

OpenAPI v3.1 gained the `const` keyword added in modern JSON Schema, which helps with describing something that can only ever be one value.

The JSON Schema tutorial uses the example of having a country field where you only support shipping to the United States for export reasons:

```yaml
properties:
  country:
    const: United States of America
```

That's one way to use it, but another is to act as a switch in a `oneOf`.

```yaml
oneOf:
  - title: Card
    properties:
      object:
        type: string
        const: card
      number:
        type: string
      cvc:
        type: integer
      exp_month:
        type: integer
      exp_year:
        type: integer
  
  - title: Bank Account
    type: object
    properties:
      object:
        const: bank_account
        type: string
      number:
        type: string
      sort_code:
        type: string
```

In this example the `object` could be `card` or `bank_account`, but instead of defining that as an enum and the other properties all have to figure out whether they relate to cards or bank accounts, we use the `const` to help match the subschema.

### default 

Setting a `default` lets people and code know what to do when a value has not been provided. 

```
type: string
enum:
  - pending
  - fulfilled
  - archived
```




### minimum & maximum

The `minimum` and `maximum` keywords allow you to specify the minimum and maximum values for numeric properties. For example:

```yaml
type: number
minimum: 0
maximum: 100
```

This schema ensures that the value of the property falls within the range of 0 to 100.

### enum

The `enum` keyword allows you to define a list of acceptable values for a property. For example:

```yaml
type: string
enum:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
```

This schema restricts the property value to be one of the specified options: "apple", "banana", or "orange".

### pattern

The `pattern` keyword allows you to enforce a specific regular expression pattern for string properties. For example:

```yaml
type: string
pattern: ^[A-Za-z]+$
```

This schema ensures that the property value consists of only alphabetic characters.

### required

The `required` keyword is used to specify the required properties within an object. For example:

```yaml
type: object
required:
  - name
  - age
```

This schema mandates that the properties "name" and "age" must be present in the object.

For more information on JSON Schema validation keywords, you can refer to the [JSON Schema Validation documentation](https://json-schema.org/learn/validation.html).

## readOnly & writeOnly

JSON Schema provides `readOnly` and `writeOnly` boolean keywords, which are really helpful in the context of an API, because resources are usually available in two flavours: the representation of a resource in a request body, and the representation of the resource in a response body.

- `readOnly: true` indicates that a value should not or cannot be be modified, but can be seen (e.g., `id`, `created_at`).

- `writeOnly: true` indicates that a value may be set, but will remain hidden (e.g., `password`, or PII like the `cvc` security code on a credit card).

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    readOnly: true
  username:
    type: string
  date_of_birth:
    type: string
    format: date-time
  password:
    type: string
    writeOnly: true
  created_at:
    type: string
    format: date-time
    readOnly: true
```

By using these, a single schema can serve both requests and responses. For example, a `User` schema can send `password` during creation (`POST`), but exclude it in the `GET` response, while fields like `id` and `created_at` are only returned. This approach reduces duplication, making schemas easier to maintain.

These two keywords are considered “annotations” in JSON Schema, which means they are only there for various bits of tooling to do something with if they like. There is no requirement for tools to do anything in particular, but a common convention for most documentation tools will be to skip listing a `readOnly` property for a HTTP POST/PATCH request body, and similarly skip documenting `writeOnly` properties in a response body. 

This same approach extends to example request/responses of JSON data generated by documentation tools, and also mock servers, and even change the parameters available for generated SDK code.

> There are some complexities here with HTTP PUT because you're meant to be sending the entire resource each time whether something is writeable or not, but if a property was removed from a sample request for an HTTP PUT request, that means: a) "send it or not, we don't care", or b) not sending it will result in it being removed. Seeing as tooling varies on this, and API implementations vary in how they interpret missing values in PUT, you just need to check the tools you use do what your API expects.
