Any API handling use-cases more advanced that purely fetching data will need to define a HTTP request body. `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `QUERY`, etc. all allow a HTTP client to send a body: often JSON or XML. This allows for more information to be sent rather than just query string parameters, which have limits.

The request body can be used for:

- Creating new resources (e.g.: booking a train ticket)
- Updating existing resources (e.g.: updating that booking)
- Uploading files (e.g.: uploading an image to your railcard)

## Structure of Request Bodies

In OpenAPI 3.x, the request body is defined using the `requestBody` object. This object allows you to specify:

- The content type (e.g.: `application/json`, `application/xml`).
- The schema that defines the structure of the request body.
- Whether the request body is required or optional.
- Descriptions for these requests to add context to API documentation.

Let's consider the [Train Travel API](https://bump.sh/blog/modern-openapi-petstore-replacement), which allows users to book train tickets.

### Creating a Resource

When a user wants to book a train ticket, they need to send details like the passenger's name, trip ID, date of travel, and seat preference, which would look a bit like this:

```yaml
paths:
  /bookings:
    post:
      summary: Book a train ticket
      description: Endpoint to book a train ticket
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                passenger_name:
                  type: string
                  example: "John Doe"
                trip_id:
                  type: string
                  example: "1234"
                date:
                  type: string
                  format: date
                  example: "2024-08-15"
                seat_preference:
                  type: string
                  enum: [window, aisle, any]
                  example: "window"
```

Here the `requestBody` object defines two important properties:

- `required: true` - indicates that the request body is mandatory for this operation.

- `content` - specifies that the request body should be in `application/json` format with the following `schema`.

The schema defines the structure of the request body, including properties like `passenger_name`, `train_id`, `date`, and `seat_preference`. This can be defined inline like this, or it can use `components` to share an [existing schema](_guides/openapi/specification/v3.2/data-models/schema-and-data-types.md) and reduce repetition.

### Updating a Resource

If a user wants to update their booking (e.g.: change the seat preference), the API can define a `PUT` or `PATCH` operation, to allow updating the entire booking, or part of the booking respectively. Either way, they need to send the updated data in the request body. Hereâ€™s how to define it:

```yaml
paths:
  /bookings/{bookingId}:
    patch:
      summary: Update a booking
      description: Endpoint to update an existing booking
      parameters:
        - name: bookingId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                seat_preference:
                  type: string
                  enum: [window, aisle, any]
                  examples:
                  - aisle
```

Here the `PATCH` method is used to describe an operation that can update one specific field from an existing booking. The `required: true` says the `requestBody` is mandatory, and the only media type defined is `application/json` so that says the request must be in that format.

The `schema` then defines the structure of the request body, which demonstrates that only the `seat_preference` property can be updated.

If multiple properties could be updated, you would define all the properties that could be updated, then show off some [examples](_guides/openapi/specification/v3.2/data-models/examples.md) for common use-cases of things users might want to do.

## File Uploads & Multipart Forms

HTTP requests can also cover more advanced scenarios like [file uploads](_guides/openapi/specification/v3.2/advanced/file-uploads.md) and [multipart form data](_guides/openapi/specification/v3.2/advanced/multipart-form-data.md), which have their own guides in the advanced section.
