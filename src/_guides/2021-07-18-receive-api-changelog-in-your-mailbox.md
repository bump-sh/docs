In API documentation, changelogs are important, and your API consumers need to stay up-to-date on recent changes.

It's now possible for them to subscribe by email to your API changelog: they will receive a summary of the changelog every week in their mailbox!

Want to see it in action on Bump API documentation? [See it live](https://developers.bump.sh/changes)

Do not hesitate to invite your API consumers to subscribe to your API updates (available at `http://{your-doc-url}/changes`)

_Never miss an API change again_ (now, it's in your mailbox in case you missed it 😉)
