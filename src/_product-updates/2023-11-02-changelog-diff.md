The lack of information between changes was repeatedly highlighted in our discussions with some of you. As the information contained in a diff was not obvious, it was sometimes difficult to visualize critical updates, which led us to take action.

With the new Changelog Diff, you get a clearer overview of EVERY change. Instead of a simple "this item has changed", you can now see specific details, allowing API users to know when to act and what they need to find out.

We've also overhauled the visual aspect of a diff. The hierarchy of information is clearer and more intuitive, as is the order of change statuses, which is now better ordered.

Now available to see on your API, or [see it in action on Bump.sh API Changelog →](https://developers.bump.sh/changes)
