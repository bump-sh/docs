As markdown is a standard and a common way to bring more readability into your documentation, we have made some improvements on markdown support and bring new features to help you create fast and beautiful API documentations.

Bump now supports common Markdown syntax, language color syntax highlighting, and information call-outs. Last but not least, Markdown can be included inside your contract file or as an external reference using dedicated Markdown files.

Check [our help page](/help/specification-support/markdown-support/) to start taking advantage of markdown in your API documentation.
