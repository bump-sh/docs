title: Bump live preview
tags: [Improvement]
---

A new `--live` flag was added to the bump `preview` command.

This gives you the ability to stay focused on your API definition file (OpenAPI or AsyncAPI file) while seeing your Bump preview documentation page being updated as you change the file.

No need for a specific text editor, or any extension, just use the bump CLI to preview your documentation live.
