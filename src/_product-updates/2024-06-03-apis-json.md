Looking for a comprehensive file listing all the APIs inside your hub? We’ve got you covered! 

We support [APIs.json](https://apisjson.org/), to automatically generate a JSON file out of your hub content. 

To access the JSON, simply add `/apis.json` at the end of your hub URL. It contains the description, type, version, documentation URL, and more about each API. 

For example, it can be used to: 
- Check in an automatic CI context that a precise list of APIs is published on your hub
- Add your APIs to an API search engine (e.g. [APIs.io](https://apis.io/))

We have also published a [detailed guide](/guides/bump-sh-tutorials/make-your-apis-discoverable-with-apisjson/) to help you get started with APIs.json.

[You can try it out on our demo hub here →](https://demo.bump.sh/apis.json)
