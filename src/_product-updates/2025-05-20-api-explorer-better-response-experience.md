title: API Explorer - Better response experience
tags: [Improvement]
---
Following feedback, we have improved the experience of the Explorer API response module.

### Increased readability
The response module can now be expanded, making it easier to read long responses.

### Images support
If an API returns an image, the API Explorer will now display it directly in the response module (for content-type: ``image/jpeg`` and ``image/png``).
