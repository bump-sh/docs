Operations and properties go through multiple states during their lifetime, from `unstable` to `beta` or `release candidate`.  This information can be crucial for your users. And more importantly, it can be completely specific to your API lifecycle. That's why we are introducing a new property named `x-state`. 

This custom property is a string that can be added inside an operation or a schema to identify it with a custom badge:

```yaml
    paths:
    /diffs:
        post:
        description: Create a diff between any two given API definitions
        x-state: Technical preview # x-state flag at the operation level
        requestBody:
            description: The diff creation request object
            content:
            application/json:
                schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                    url:
                    type: string
                    format: uri
                    x-state: Still unstable # x-state flag at the schema level
                    description: |
                        **Required** if `definition` is not present.
                        Current definition URL. It should be accessible through HTTP by Bump.sh servers.
```
In this example, we added an `x-state` property to the operation itself, and one of its properties.
