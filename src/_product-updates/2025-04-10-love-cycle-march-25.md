title: Love cycle - March 25
tags: [Improvement]
---
Every now and then between larger product cycles, the whole team gets together to polish the product by working on small enhancements and user requests, in a time called "Love cycle".

Here's a list of what's been worked on.

Improvements:
- You can now easily list all your organization's hubs using the new ``GET /hubs`` [endpoint in our API](https://developers.bump.sh/operation/operation-listhubs),
- Our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/bump-sh-api-documentation-changelog) has been updated and now supports overlays,
- [Bump.sh CLI](https://github.com/bump-sh/cli): 
  - A message is now displayed at every document update, so you know the CLI is running and updating the preview properly,
  - When using `bump overlay`, we now display a message if an overlay doesn't match anything,
  - When using `bump deploy`, an explicit message is displayed if the target directory doesn't exist.
- Security badges are now displayed for webhooks,
- CLI and GitHub Action code samples in your hub/documentation settings now contain real slugs and tokens to speed up Bump.sh integration into your workflow.

Fixes:
- Autogenerated date-time and time string examples now follow the ISO RFC 3339 format recommended by OpenAPI, and are displayed as `2017-07-21T17:32:28Z`,
- The markdown support in documentation has been audited and multiple visual enhancements and fixes have been applied, improving visual hierarchy and readability,
- Security Schemes from OpenAPI V2 definition files are now displayed in the documentation,
- The top navigation has been reworked to offer a consistent experience across all views (Documentation, Changelog, API Explorer),
- Security badges have been reworked to ensure that they always correctly redirect to the authentication page and are displayed consistently,
- Descriptions of array[object] are now displayed in the documentation.

As usual, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, feedback, or features you would like to see added to the product. Knock at [hello@bump.sh](mailto:hello@bump.sh)
