title: Hub UI customization
---

These hub settings are applied by default to all the documentation it contains. From the Hub Settings tab, you can customize several general options.

## UI design and branding

It is also possible to modify the settings of a documentation within a hub to customize it differently.
  
You can customize the visual appearance of your hub and its documentation by adding your logo and favicon directly from this section. By default, Bump.sh automatically generates a social media visual for you (when you share the URL of your hub or documentation on one of them). However, you can still choose your own image by uploading it at this step.

You can also customize the general color scheme of your hub.

## Dark mode

By default, we apply filters to make your light mode color and logo blend in dark mode. To ensure brand consistency, you can define a custom logo and color dedicated to dark mode.

## Operations sorting

Finally, you can choose to apply a general sorting parameter to all the documentations in your hub with the Group by operations (by path or tag) and Navigation options.

## Documentation listing

This setting is useful when you have multiple API docs that you want to publish in a same Hub, and consider grouping them under categories.

Categories can be, for instance, groups of API that belong to a same business domain. Categories must be specified for each doc in the hub. [Read how to set categories on a doc](/help/publish-documentation/create-and-manage-documentation/#categorize-docs-in-a-hub).

When the "Group documentation by category" setting is selected, any documentation with no specified category will not be displayed in the Hub.

## Filter documentation selector based on categories

Hub categories can filter the documentation selector in the top navigation bar of a documentation, so readers only see relevant docs from the same category, improving navigation.
