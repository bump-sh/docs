## Where can I find my MCP servers?

Your MCP servers are listed in your dashboard, alongside your APIs and hubs. If you don't have any MCP server, the dedicated section will be at the bottom of your dashboard, below your API docs.

## Create an MCP server

To create a new MCP server, go to your dashboard and click on the "New MCP server" button. A few essential information are required.

| Server name | The name of the MCP server as it will appear to those who have access to it. |
| Server URL | The server URL allows you to define the URL of your MCP server, in the format `https://your-org.bump.sh/mcp/your-path`. If empty, the path will be generated based on the server name. |
| Deployment method | Allows you to choose the deployment type that best suits your workflow. You can modify it at any time. |
