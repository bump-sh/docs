- TOC
{:toc}

The generation of your API documentation is based on your API definition, which must adhere to one of the standards we support (OpenAPI/Swagger and AsyncAPI.).

To allow you to enrich your documentation, we support common Markdown syntax, including call-outs and the addition of images, for example.

You can integrate Markdown directly into your API document or as an [external reference](/help/enhance-documentation-content/markdown-support/#markdown-files-as-an-external-reference) pointing to Markdown files.

## Common Markdown syntax support

|Formatting|Markdown Syntax|Rendering|
|---|---|---|
|bold|`**bold**`|**bold**|
|italic|`_italic_`|_italic_|
|link|`[links](https://bump.sh)`|[links](https://bump.sh/)|
|inline code|`̀ inline code ̀`|`inline code`|
|highlight|`==highlight==`|[highlight](https://bump.sh/)|
|strike-through|`~~strikethrough~~`|~~strikethrough~~|
|footnote|`Footnote[^1]`|Footnote[^1]|
|quotes|`> quotes`| > quotes |

### Titles & headings

- Heading 1: `# A first-level title`
- Heading 2: `## A second-level title`
- Heading 3: `### A third-level title`

## Multi-line code blocks with language color syntax highlighting

E.g.

```undefined
    ```json
    {
      "hello": "world",
      "number": 1,
      "boolean": true
    }
    ```
```

will render:

```javascript
{
  "hello": "world",
  "number": 1,
  "boolean": true
}
```

### Information call-outs

Bump.sh supports information call-outs (of type `info`, `warn`, `success` or `error`) with the quote markdown syntax (lines starting with `> ` ) if the first line contains one of the call-out types.

E.g.

```undefined
> info
> this is an important information to **standout**.
```

will render:

> this is an important information to **standout**.
{: .info}

## Diagrams and charts (Mermaid Support)

The direct integration of Mermaid via our Markdown support allows you to display diagrams and charts to visually illustrate key information, making it easier to understand. You can find the full list of diagrams supported by Mermaid on [this page](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html).

To create your diagram or chart, we recommend referring to Mermaid’s syntax guide, available [in their documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html). It provides detailed syntax instructions for each type.

To generate one, add a code block declared as `mermaid` inside a `description` or `content` property:

```yaml
  get:
    description: |
      ```mermaid
      erDiagram
        CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : has
        CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
        CUSTOMER ||--o{ INVOICE : "liable for"
        DELIVERY-ADDRESS ||--o{ ORDER : receives
        INVOICE ||--|{ ORDER : covers
        ORDER ||--|{ ORDER-ITEM : includes
        PRODUCT-CATEGORY ||--|{ PRODUCT : contains
        PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDER-ITEM : "ordered in"
      ```
```
This example would render the following diagram [(see it live)](https://bump.sh/demo/doc/mermaid-demo/operation/operation-get-booking-parameter):

## Images

Use the following syntax to add images in your markdown:
```
![Alt text](/path/to/image.jpg "Image title")
```

Please, don't forget to add an [alt-text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute#Usage) to your images: this description helps make them accessible to all your readers.

### Image sizing

If you want to manually set the size of your image you can use our custom `=dimension` parameter just before the closing parenthesis as:

pre><code><%= resource.data.image_sizing_markdown %></code></pre>

`=dimension` uses the following syntax:
```
=[width][unit]x[height][unit]
```

for instance using `=100pxx50px` where 
- `100` is the `width`
- `px` the `unit`
- `x` the `separator`
- `50` the `height`
- second `px` is `unit` again
will output an image with 100 pixels height and 50 pixels width.

At least one `height` *or* `width` parameter is mandatory, everything else being optional.

```
=100pxx50px   # with everything
=100x50       # without unit
=100          # without height (x separator not needed) and unit
=100px        # without height
=x50          # without width and unit
=x50px        # without width
```

>- If you don't specify a `unit` it will default to pixel.
- If you don't specify `width` *or* `height`, the other value will be a ratio calculated from the original size of the image so it doesn't shrink.
{: .info}

You can use any of the following CSS length units as `unit`:

**Absolute units**:
- `cm` centimeters
- `mm` millimeters
- `in` inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
- `px` pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
- `pt` points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
- `pc` picas (1pc = 12 pt)

**Relative units**:
- `em` relative to the font-size of the element (usually 1em = 16px)
- `ex` relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)  
- `ch` relative to the width of the "0" (Unicode U +0030) in the current font
- `rem` relative to font-size of the root element   
- `vw` relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*  
- `vh` relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*   
- `vmin` relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension   
- `vmax` relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension  
- `%` relative to the parent element

## Markdown files as an external reference

Markdown files can be included as an [external reference](/help/specification-support/references) within your API definition with the $ref syntax `$ref: "./path/to/local-markdown.md"`.

In the same way you can extract part of your API definition (usually JSON schema of your models into dedicated `*.yaml` or `*.json` files), you can extract your markdown content into dedicated files too.

**E.g.** Your OpenAPI file `api-contract.yml` can thus looks like:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Bump API documentation
  version: 1.0.0
  description:
    $ref: "./docs/introduction.md"
servers:
  ...
paths:
  ...
```

These files will be rendered within your documentation as if they were part of your API definition.
