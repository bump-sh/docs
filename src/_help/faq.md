## Will you support others specifications like BluePrint or GraphQL?

When we initially had the Bump idea, we though that it would be absolutely perfect to be able to handle any kind of documentation.

This said, at the moment, we are focusing on OpenAPI and AsyncAPI to offer the best support of these specifications.

## Why not supporting all the OpenAPI specification?

If you have tried Bump, you probably have already discovered that we don't support the whole Swagger / OpenApi specification.

There are 2 reasons for that:

- first, we are a fresh new project, which is far from being complete. So we may have decided to postpone some features due to our priorities.
- second, we may have decided that a specification feature adds too much complexity to the documentation, and have preferred to simply ignore it to keep things simple for now.

Feel free to <a class="intercom-launcher-selector" href="mailto:help@bump.sh">ask us</a> why a feature you need is missing, we'll be happy to answer and try to find a solution with you.
