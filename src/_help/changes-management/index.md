Tracking API changes is essential, both for API builders and consumers.

## What is a change

A change is a modification of your API with an impact on its behavior. <br>
Changes are differentiated into various categories:

| Documentation change     | a description is modified  |
| Structural change        | the structure of the API is modified  |
| [Breaking change](/help/getting-started/concepts/#breaking-change)    | a major change in your API  requires an update to the code consuming it |

## How to manage and track changes

[Changelog](/help/changes-management/changelog/) is a crucial feature of Bump.sh, recording the history of all deployments and detailing changes compared to previous versions.

The [changes comparison](/help/changes-management/changelog/#compare-changelog-entries/) allows you to compare two deployed API definitions, regardless of differences in dates or branches.

Bump.sh offers [various notification options](/help/changes-management/changelog/#email--rss-notifications/), whether it's integration into your existing workflows or email notifications, you can be confident that you'll stay informed about important changes.
