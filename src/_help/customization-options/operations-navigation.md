Bump.sh offers several methods for sorting your API operations to provide a smooth and coherent reading structure, based on either the tags or operation names and URLs.

Supported API specifications allow for several types of requests:

- Endpoints are typically URLs that point to a specific resource on an API server. In OpenAPI, endpoints are stored under the `paths` resource.
- Webhooks are requests generated by the API and sent to an external server after a specific event has occurred. In OpenAPI 3.1, they are stored under the `webhooks` resource.

> If first-level field `tags` are present at the [root of your OpenAPI document object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#openapi-object), Bump.sh will use `Group by tags` as a default documentation generation behaviour.

## Group operations by path

When `Group operations by path`` is chosen, Bump.sh deduces group names from related paths. The first part of the path is extracted to generate the group name, and every operation related to it will be grouped together.

## Group operations by tag

When group operation by tag is selected, Bump.sh will use the [`tags`](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#tag-object) from your API definition to group, name and sort operations.

Tags offer you better customization of your documentation, going beyond the resource names. You can also add a description for each tag, which will appear in the header of your documentation.

> When "Group operations by tag" is selected, operations without tags will be ignored and won't be displayed.
