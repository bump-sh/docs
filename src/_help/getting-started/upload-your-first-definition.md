Publishing your first API documentation on Bump.sh will only take you a few moments. Creating an account, documentation, and uploading your first API definition can be done in just a few clicks.

## Create your Bump.sh account

The very first step is to create your Bump.sh account.

Two options are available: using your email address, or through your GitHub account.

## Create your first documentation

### Step 1: Create your organization

Now that your Bump.sh account is created, you will immediately be prompted to create your first organization.
An organization allows you to work alone or collaboratively on your API documentation and hubs (a collection of documentation) within the same workspace.
