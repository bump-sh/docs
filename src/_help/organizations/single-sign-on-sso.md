Bump.sh supports Single Sign-On through your Identity and Access Management systems, to ease who in your organization can access admin permissions.

Our Single Sign-On feature relies on WorkOS, which supports a [wide variety of integrations](https://workos.com/docs/integrations) with third-party Identity and Access Management solutions (e.g. generic SAML, SCIM, OpenID, as well as Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, Azure AD, Google SAML and more).

## Activating SSO for your organization

SSO is available on our [Business plans](https://bump.sh/pricing?utm_source=bump&utm_medium=help_center).

Once you have purchased a Business plan, please [reach out to our support team](mailto:hello@bump.sh) to have the feature activated on your account.

We will send you a URL that will let you complete the configuration, picking the Identity and Access Management solution you need.

## Configuring user permissions

By default, all users who get access to Bump.sh via the configured SSO will have the [“Viewer” Role/Permission](../#member-management).

The Organization Owner may [configure different permission levels](../#member-management) for each user via the Bump.sh administration user interface.
