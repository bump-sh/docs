Redoc is a great Open Source tool for generating API docs from OpenAPI contracts. Bump.sh powers that too, while lifting the weight of tooling maintenance and adding key features.

# Top 3 reasons to choose Bump.sh over Redoc

## Focus on your APIs code, we publish the docs

Hands on your code, hands off tooling. Our job is to give you no-brainer ways to publish those API specification files when, where and to whom you want to. And to support you when something goes wrong. Nothing to install and maintain on your servers.

## Change Management

Bump.sh compares and highlights changes in between your API versions, and warns you if anything is breaking.

## Multiple API specifications support

Beyond OpenAPI, Bump.sh also supports AsyncAPI, helping you to centralize all API docs in a single place.

# More things you won’t get with Redoc

## Documentation Hub
Centralize a documented catalog of all your APIs, search and browse through a single developer portal.

## Advanced Search
Search for terms across all your docs and get semantically grouped results that help you find what you are looking for.

## Branching
Deploy and maintain multiple documentation versions, whether they are released or work in progress, and let users pick the branch they’re working with.

## User Access Management
Whether you want to give access to your whole team via SSO, or set fine grained permissions at a user level and doc level, we’ve got your back. You’re in control of who sees what.

## Developer Experience
We take pride in beautiful design, and just as much in comfortable and convenient workspaces. We build tools that make your life easier.
