Bump.sh, compared to APIMatic, fully leverages the power of SaaS to let you publish branded API documentation portals. You won't have to embed scripts in another portal. Bump.sh provides all of the convenient features that let you customize and publish modern and stunning docs.

# Top 3 reasons to choose Bump.sh over APIMatic

## SaaS, with full control over your brand

Don’t pick between non-customizable or self-hosted white-label. Easily publish your docs on Bump.sh, with your branding and custom domain.

## Change Management

Bump.sh compares and highlights changes in between your API versions, and warns you if anything is breaking.

## Multiple API specifications support

Beyond OpenAPI, Bump.sh also supports AsyncAPI, helping you to centralize all API docs in a single place.

# More things you won’t get with APIMatic

## Out-of-the-box API Catalog

Bump.sh Hubs let you centralize and organize the access to all of you APIs’ documentation, without the burden of mapping it to and embedding it into another dev portal.

## SEO-friendly

Make sure your Public APIs are correctly indexed by search engines, gain visibility and improve accessibility for your community.

## Stunning Docs

Don’t take our word for it. Try it yourself. Be warned, you might never go back!

## Branching and versioning

Bump.sh and APIMatic have that in common to let you manage multiple versions of your APIs. Bump.sh goes one step further with branches management: deploy docs automatically for each Git branch (and enjoy our changelog feature even more).

## User Access Management

Want to publish private or partner docs? With APIMatic, you’ll either embed a code snippet in other docs which have restricted access, or opt for their white label offering. With Bump.sh, just set the access level you need from our portal.
