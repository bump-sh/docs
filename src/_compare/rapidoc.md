RapiDoc is an Open Source tool that you could use to create documentation from OpenAPI contracts. Let us tell you how Bump.sh nails the game and why you’ll want to pick it instead.

# Top 3 reasons to choose Bump.sh over RapiDoc

## Out-of-the-box documentation experience

No servers to setup. No cumbersome configuration, no code or SDK to get started. Integrate with your Git repository and voilà! Always up-to-date docs, with no further effort.

## Iterate with confidence

We’ll let you (and anyone using your API) know if you introduced a change. We’ll even send an alert if that change breaks anything. On Slack. Or your Pull Request. Or anywhere you need.

## No architectural style limit

Through our support of OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, we help you centralize all of your docs in a single place, whether they’re REST or event-driven APIs.

# More things you won’t get with RapiDoc

## Centralized docs for all your APIs

In the same way than with Swagger UI, RapiDoc can help you publish one doc per API. Each on a separate URL. Bump.sh helps you offer a single entry point for your users to browse and search through all docs.

## SEO-friendly

Also similarly to Swagger or Redoc, RapiDoc renders documentation through a Javascript module, directly in your user’s browser. Which means no crawling engine will ever find your public API doc.

## Unified and Advanced Search Engine

Search for terms across all your docs and get unique, semantically grouped results that help you find what you are looking for. Not sure how to do a POST /user anymore? Hit the search and find the right API, with all the information your need.

## SaaS-powered

Self-hosted software may sound enticing sometimes, as it gives that sensation of control. But with great power comes great responsibility. We’ll make sure your doc is always up and running, and you can count on our support team to assist whenever you face an issue.

## Stunning Docs

It may sound opinionated and we don’t pretend they’re as pretty as Stripe’s API docs. What’s really cool about ours is that they’re generated automatically, and therefore pretty for public, partner AND private APIs.

## Branching and versioning

Navigate between versions of a same API doc, whether live or dev branches. In theory, you can build that yourself with RapiDoc. With Bump.sh, it’s natively supported.

## User Access Management

Whether you want to give access to your whole team via SSO, or set fine grained permissions at a user level and doc level, we’ve got your back. You’re in control of who sees what.

## Developer Experience

Beautiful design is important, but it's nothing without comfortable and convenient workspaces. We build tools that make your life easier. CLI, API, CI Integration, GitHub Action, and a lot more.
