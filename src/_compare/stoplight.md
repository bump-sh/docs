We built Bump.sh so that you can build APIs and publish their docs no matter how you work. No matter how you generate API schemas, or which other tools you want to use.

# Top 3 reasons to choose Bump.sh over Stoplight.io

## You choose how to work, we assist

Code-first or design-first, it doesn’t matter to us. Using Bump.sh rather than a solution which integrates the whole design flow lets you pick the approach that suits you. We focus on API docs and change management, and we do it well. You’re free to use any mocking or design tool (even Prism and Spectral).

## Automated changes detection

The Bump.sh API change log is automatically generated. That means no manual work to do, which you’ll enjoy especially when you start dealing with multiple APIs. Better, it also means that you don’t need to figure out the changes yourself. We’ll even send you alerts if any of them is breaking.

## You choose the technology, we support

Don’t be limited by technology choices and architectural style. Whether it’s REST or Event-Driven: we support both OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications.


# More things you won’t get with Stoplight.io

## Blazing fast performance

Go ahead, try it. Enter a Stoplight-generated doc page URL at [https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). Then upload the same doc to Bump.sh and do the same test.

## Full-page API Explorer

Some API requests can be parameter-heavy, whether because of their complexity or the number. Bump.sh was built with that in mind, and offers a dedicated space for you to try out sending requests while remaining in the context of the API documentation.

And that, with the Bump.sh touch, including neat features like the "Share request" which help you give instant reproducers to collaborators, or insert them in API guides.

## Centralize all the things

Our product engineering choices were different from the start. GitHub, Gitlab, anywhere you host your specifications: mix’n match it all in Bump.sh Hubs.

## Single page UX

We like seamless browsing experience, and got inspired by the best API builders (hello, Stripe). Less clicks. The possibility to use only our keyboard, also to start a search. We hope you’ll enjoy that, too.

## Sharing more than a doc page

Those docs are meant to be shared, right? Bump.sh features a cool “highlight-and share” feature that lets you, well, highlight a specific paragraph you’ll want to show someone. Not just a full page they’ll need to dig into. And when you want to share something publicly, enjoy our custom meta-images support. Nothing more annoying than when you have no control over those on social media.
