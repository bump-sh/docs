Swagger UI is a renown and historical Open Source documentation generator. Bump.sh is the alternative that brings in the modernity and flexibility you were looking for.

# Top 3 reasons to choose Bump.sh over Swagger UI

## Publish docs like you just donâ€™t care ðŸ™Œ

Whether you are a PM or a developer, publishing an API doc on Bump.sh doesnâ€™t require any code. Upload your specification file, change UI settings and tweak access management directly via our app. Of course, the comfort of your CLI is still at your hands.

## Stay on top of those API changes

Bump.sh automatically compares and highlights changes in between your API versions, and warns you if anything is breaking. No manual work needed. Safety-first.

## REST, Event-driven, weâ€™ve got your back

The architectural choice is yours. We support you whether you work with OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specifications. Or both.


# More things you wonâ€™t get with Swagger UI

## Documentation Hub

Centralize a documented catalog of all your APIs, search and browse through a single developer portal.

## SEO-friendly

Swagger UI renders documentation through a Javascript module, directly directly in your userâ€™s browser. Which means no crawling engine will ever find your public API doc.

## Advanced Search

Search for terms across all your docs and get unique, semantically grouped results that help you find what you are looking for.

## SaaS-powered

Self-hosted software may sound enticing sometimes, as it gives that sensation of control. But with great power comes great responsibility. Weâ€™ll make sure your doc is always up and running, and you can count on our support team to assist whenever you face an issue.

## Stunning Docs

It may sound opinionated and we donâ€™t pretend theyâ€™re as pretty as Stripeâ€™s API docs. Hum... wait, actually: they are prettier! And whatâ€™s really cool about ours is that theyâ€™re generated automatically, and therefore pretty for public, partner AND private private APIs.

## Branching and versioning

Navigate between versions of a same API doc, whether live or dev branches. In theory, you can build that yourself with Swagger UI. With Bump.sh, itâ€™s natively supported.

## User Access Management

Whether you want to give access to your whole team via SSO, or set fine grained permissions at a user level and doc level, weâ€™ve got your back. Youâ€™re in control of who sees what.

## Developer Experience

We take pride in beautiful design, and just as much in comfortable and convenient workspaces. We build tools that make your life easier.
